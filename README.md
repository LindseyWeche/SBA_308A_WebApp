# SBA_308A_WebApp
<h1> Fanm Solid </h1>
<p>This concept is my WebApp project, inspired by what I've seen in my country and also everywhere. Where the Women of color can't talk about harrasment or sexaul assault because they think the society going to judge them or make them feel responsible for being in this kind of situation.<p>
<h4><u>Meaning: </u></h4>
<p> Fanm Solid is an haitian creole term that means "Strong Woman" <p>
<h4><u> Objective </u></h4>
<p>Fanm Solid is a safe place where Women victimed from harassment or sexual assault can talk freely, have support from other women or specialist and also be aware of what's going with the post of related news.<p>

## How did I Proceed
<p>In this Project I work with Three main folders/files : JS, CSS and index.html and also work with the module system ; I created two modules : search.js and validateinfo.js <p> 
<p> To make this project dynamic where the user will come back often, I used fetch Api with different Methods like GET, POST. I also maked use of Promise and async/await syntax <p>

## What's on the Page
<p> On the page you will find the logo , a navigation bar, a search bar, a slide picture to show different movement and a description about what harassment and sexual assault are and how to deal with it, two different forms, an sign up and one where you can leave a comment anonymously and the footer. A lot of elements in the page are clickable like the buttons , logo to interact more with the customer. <p>

## Issues
I had some using the Api , I couldn't find exactly the one I needed for my project and also with the modules system when I export/import the content disappear on my live server.
